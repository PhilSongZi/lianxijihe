## The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
* just remember and do as thee.
* 
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

## 重看的查漏补缺：
1. PEP-8：多单词下划线连接，受保护的实例属性用单个下划线开头，私有的实例属性以双下划线开头。另外，命名做到见名知意。
2. 练习1：1.判断一个数是否是素数。2.求输入两个正数的最小公倍数和最大公约数。
3. 练习2:1.水仙花数。2.百钱百鸡问题。3.CRAPR赌博游戏。4.生成斐波那契数列的前20个数。5.找出10000以内的完美数。6.找出100以内的所有素数。
